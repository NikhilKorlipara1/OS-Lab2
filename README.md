# OS-Lab2
Building a simplified version of the Unix shell called the New Yet Usable Shell, or nyush

In this lab, I wrote a simple command parser, was able to run simple programs, run programs with arguments, handled simple built-in commands, handle output redirection and input redirection, run two programs with one pipe and multiple pipes.
